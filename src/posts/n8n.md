# First Steps with n8n and Testing Simple Workflows

## Why n8n?

I stumbled across **n8n**, an open-source automation tool that feels like a more flexible Zapier. Instead of wiring services together with clicks only, it lets me **drop in custom code nodes**, handle branching logic, and keep things self-hosted if I want. The possibilities seem sort of endless with n8n and the integration of AI.

## My First Workflow

To get started, I set up something simple:

- A trigger on a schedule
- A call to an API
- A quick transform in JavaScript
- A notification to myself

In the editor it looks like boxes and arrows, but the flow feels like building a function, just more visual.
